# Hellow Markdown!

It is **soooo** nice to be able to write in this simple format.

Once you get the hand of *it*, you just:

* Remember the basic syntax
* Write your doc
* Done!

Now you can be a Wiz at this language and code stuff up like `console.writeline("Hellow Markdown!");`

Can't remember the language? No Problem! Just visit one of these resources:
